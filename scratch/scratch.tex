\section{Experimental Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ran for random integral distributions; need them for u.a.r. real distributions (running now).  So far these are harder for CPLEX to solve by a large margin.  Why?  Bounding easier.
\item Had some Zipf distribution runs from earlier, probably going to be subsumed by better experiments.
\end{enumerate}
